        <h2>Potentially interesting facts about me</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                I'm a trans woman. I first came out in middle school, but only began medically transitioning in my last year of college. If we are old acquaintances and haven't met in a long time, 
                you might only know me by my deadname.

                I am an estranged <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom">furry</a>. If you know me long and well enough, you know that my fursona is a 
                yellow-and-purple cat. I still hope to get a fursuit in the future and attend furry conventions again.

                My Spotify playlist consists exclusively of anime and video game soundtracks, J-Pop, and covers by VTubers. Before I became an Otaku, I was obsessed with Bowie.

                My favorite video games are (in no particular order): Super Smash Bros. Melee, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Pokemon Emerald (and fan-games based on Emerald),
                and Super Mario Galaxy (1 and 2).
